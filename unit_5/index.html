			<p>From an early age, Marissa was drawn to the world of politics and civic technology, though she did not know what civic tech was at the time. In her formative years, Marissa founded her own non-partisan political website geared toward encouraging the &quot;millennial generation&quot; to get involved in the political process. After spending the better part of her career fundraising for local and statewide officials in New York, she returned to the civic tech community by way of the start-up Democracy.com, where she served as Director of Operations, and most recently as Founding Director of Events for Civic Hall, a community center for civic tech. Marissa is a graduate of Brandeis University with a degree in Politics and Theatre Arts. </p>
